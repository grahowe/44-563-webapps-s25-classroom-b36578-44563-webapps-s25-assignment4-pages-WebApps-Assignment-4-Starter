                Bound by my charity and my blest order,
                I come to visit the afflicted spirits
                Here in the prison. Do me the common right
                To let me see them and to make me know
                The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
                To them accordingly.

                Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
                Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
                Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
                And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
                More fit to do another such offence
                Than die for this.

                As I do think, to-morrow.
                I have provided for you: stay awhile,

                I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
                And try your penitence, if it be sound,
                Or hollowly put on.

                So then it seems your most offenceful act
                Was mutually committed?

            <p class="speech juliet">I do confess it, and repent it, father.</p>

                'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
                As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
                Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
                Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
                But as we stand in fear,--
