                Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
                As for the brat of this accursed duke,

                How now! is he dead already? or is it fear

                So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
                That trembles under his devouring paws;
                And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
                And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
                Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
                And not with such a cruel threatening look.
                Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
                I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
                Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

                In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
                Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.

                Then let my father's blood open it again:

                Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
                Were not revenge sufficient for me;
                No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
                And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
                It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
                The sight of any of the house of York
                Is as a fury to torment my soul;
                And till I root out their accursed line
                And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
                Therefore--

                He be as miserably slain as I.
                Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
                And when I give occasion of offence,
                Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
